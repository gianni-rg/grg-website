Title: Compilare Caffe2 e Detectron con supporto GPU su Windows (Parte 2 di 2)
Published: 2018-10-03 15:00:00

Description: In the last couple of weeks, I had the need to test and use some custom models made with Caffe2 framework and Detectron. They are actively developed on Linux, but I needed to have them run on Windows 10 with CUDA GPU support. This post (part 2 of 2) is a step-by-step guide on how I did it, hoping it can help other people with the same need.
