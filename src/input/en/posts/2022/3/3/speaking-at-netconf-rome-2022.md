Together with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clemente-giorio-03a61811/" target="_blank">Clemente Giorio</a>, *Microsoft MVP* and colleague in <a href="https://www.deltatre.com" target="_blank">**Deltatre**</a>, I will co-present the session **Deep Learning with ML.NET** (in Italian, at 3PM), where we'll see how to train and serve deep learning models leveraging .NET technologies.

Machine Learning and Deep Learning are more and more utilized at all levels, from embedded devices to web browsers. In this session, we will see how we can leverage our .NET expertise and tools to develop applications that utilize AI models: with a practical approach, we explore a different way to use the most common machine learning/deep learning frameworks to train and score models in .NET.

The event is free, thanks to the sponsors, but <a href="https://www.eventbrite.it/e/registrazione-rome-net-conference-2022-268350332067" target="_blank">registration</a> is required. Agenda details can be found <a href="https://www.dotnetconf.it/agenda" target="_blank">here</a>.
