Description: I'd like to invite you to attend the AI Day 2022 in presence and online event, a free full day of talks organized by .NET Code, on November 18. Together with Clemente Giorio, Microsoft MVP and colleague of mine in Deltatre, I will co-present (remotely) a session about theory and techniques to optimize Deep Learning models. In this session we'll discuss the possible different layers of incremental improvements for deep learning models, from architecture review to dataset cleaning, and we'll share our experience leveraging Azure Machine Learning services and other open-source tools and frameworks.
