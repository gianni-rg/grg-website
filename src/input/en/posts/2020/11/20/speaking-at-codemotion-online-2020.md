Description: Hi all, I'm happy to invite you to attend Codemotion Online 2020 (Italian Edition). I will co-present a session with Elena Terenzi from Microsoft, about the joint Deltatre and Microsoft projects we did in the previous months. It's about exploring and implementing video action recognition in sport content, from prototype to production, with Azure Machine Learning and other open-source tools and frameworks. That's a great honour, and I'm very glad to be part of the speaker staff again, as did in previous Codemotion editions.
