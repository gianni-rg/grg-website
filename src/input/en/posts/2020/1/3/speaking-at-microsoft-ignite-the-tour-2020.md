Description: Hi all, I'm happy to announce that I've been selected as speaker at the Microsoft Ignite The Tour 2020 conference, in Milan (Italy).

Hi all, I'm happy to announce that I've been selected as speaker at the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/it-it/ignite-the-tour/milan" target="_blank">Microsoft Ignite The Tour 2020 conference</a>, in Milan (Italy). The conference will take place on **January 27-28, 2020**. That's a great honour, and I'm very glad to be part of the speaker staff again, as did in <a href="/en/posts/2019/09/06/speaking-at-microsoft-ignite-2019.html">Microsoft Ignite 2019</a> conference in Orlando.

This year I've been selected for one session, in two forms: 1 teather (15min) and 1 breakout (45min). If you're at Microsoft Ignite The Tour, come to hear me!

* **Applied Deep Learning: new kind of multimedia content**

    I will describe new AI-based techniques to generate and enhance video content, derived from <a href="https://www.deltatre.com" target="_blank">Deltatre's Innovation Lab team</a> experiments. Starting from some basic theory, will see some code, models and practical demos on new Deep Learning approaches able, for example, to slow down videos, increase quality/resolution, apply style-transfer, detect and track objects, faces and people.

Sessions scheduling is the following:

* **Applied Deep Learning: new kind of multimedia content** (15min) will be on January 27th, h4.05-4.20PM, Theater 3
* **Applied Deep Learning: new kind of multimedia content** (45min) will be on January 28th, h12.15-1PM, Amber 5+6

See you in Milan!
