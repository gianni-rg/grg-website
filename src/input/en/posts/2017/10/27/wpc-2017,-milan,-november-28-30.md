Hello to all. I'd like to highlight the traditional yearly appointment with <span>**<a href="http://www.wpc2017.it/" target="_blank">WPC 2017</a>**, the main Italian conference about Microsoft technologies. It's the 24th edition, organized in Milan (Italy) **from November 28th to November 30th** by OverNet Education. The session list is almost ready and it will be soon available online: also this year, it is very rich with sessions about dev tools, Mixed Reality AI and web/app developement.  

 This year I'm glad to be speaker again, with <a href="http://www.wpc2017.it/cms/it-IT/SpeakerPage?parameters%5B0%5D=70" target="_blank">a session</a> about **Microsoft technologies for Artificial Intelligence**. We'll see which are the services provided by Microsoft and how they work, from Cognitive Services to Machine Learning, passing by Deep Learning with CNTK. All will be applied to explore in an automatic way our data available online.</span>
