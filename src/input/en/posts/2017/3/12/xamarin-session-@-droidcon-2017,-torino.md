Thanks to the **<a href="http://it.droidcon.com/2017/">droidcon Italia 2017</a>** organizers and **Microsoft**, on **April 6th, in Turin (Italy)** I'll present a technical session about **cross-platform mobile apps development with .NET and Xamarin**.

For those who don't know it, *droidcon* is one of the most important and big event for Android developers. This year, *the fourth edition*, the event will be on **April 6-7 in Torino**: two full days of technical sessions presented by <a href="http://it.droidcon.com/2017/speakers/" target="_blank">national and internazional expert speakers</a>, some directly from Google.

<a href="http://it.droidcon.com/2017/sessions/your-first-steps-into-virtual-reality/" target="_blank">In my session about Xamarin</a>, at 3:10PM on the first day, we'll have a look at the Xamarin tools to develop cross-platform mobile apps with C# and .NET, focusing on the the architecture and best practices to develop once and deploy on Android, Windows and iOS. We'll have an overview of Visual Studio and Xamarin tools to design cross-platform UI (based on Xamarin Forms) and we'll go a little deep on the optimal architecture to adopt (MVVM and other design patterns) to enable code sharing and reuse between Android, iOS and Windows, analyzing a sample native application with cloud backend/API.
