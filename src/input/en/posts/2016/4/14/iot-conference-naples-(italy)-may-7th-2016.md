As usual since the past years, a new appointment with the Embedded and IoT world returns to Naples (Italy): the **"IoT Conference"**.

The free event will be on **Saturday, May 7th 2016 in Naples (Italy)**, organized by <a href="http://www.dotnetcampania.org/" target="_blank">DotNetCampania</a> community and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/it-it/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> Italy. It will be about *Internet of Things* and all related technologies, from micro-devices to the cloud, passing through *wearables*, Virtual Reality and other technologies.

As in the past years, there will be all the Italian Microsoft Windows Embedded/IoT MVPs.

I will be there, together with <a href="http://beppeplatania.com/it" target="_blank">Beppe Platania</a>, and we'll present a session about **Virtual Reality**: we'll have a short introduction to VR, its technologies and devices (wearable headsets, sensors, Kinect, etc.) and we'll see how to develop for VR using Unity 3D and Samsung Gear VR. In addition, we'll see the <a href="http://www.immotionar.com/en/services/immotionroom-virtual-space-immersion/" target="_blank">ImmotionAR ImmotionRoom solution</a> which enables room-scale tracking (and beyond) for Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR, Razer OSVR and Google Cardboard. You can't miss it!
