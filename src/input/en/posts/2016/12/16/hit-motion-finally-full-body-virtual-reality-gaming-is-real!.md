I'm happy to announce that <a href="http://www.immotionar.com" target="_blank">Immotionar</a>, the <a href="http://www.bepseng.it" target="_blank">Beps Engineering</a> division I'm leading, has just released **Hit Motion**, **the first game where you can exploit your full body inside virtual reality**! The game leverages <a href="http://www.immotionar.com/en/services/immotionroom-your-full-body-in-virtual-reality/" target="_blank">ImmotionRoom technology</a> to let you see your full avatar and **use any part of the body to interact with the virtual world**!

This magic is made mixing virtual reality headsets (tethered like Oculus Rift, OSVR, HTC Vive, or untethered ones like Samsung Gear VR or Google Cardboard) with body tracking sensors (Microsoft Kinects v1 or v2). *This way you can truly feel inside virtual reality and live wonderful experiences*.

Have a look at the official trailer on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfjvu2PXW-0" target="_blank">Immotionar YouTube channel</a>.

As the name suggests, **the game is all about moving inside a ring in the outer space and hitting enemy space robots that come next to you**: the more you hit, the more you score points. The more you score points, the more you are awesome. *Feedbacks from first beta users are enthusiastic*: the game proves to be very funny and also helps you in staying fit since you have to run from one part to the other of your room.
