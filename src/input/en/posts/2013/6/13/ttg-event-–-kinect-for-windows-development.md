On June 20th, as every month, there will be the <a href="http://www.torinotechnologiesgroup.it" target="_blank">Torino Technologies Group</a> (TTG) community event, hosted in <a href="http://www.mictorino.it/web/" target="_blank">Microsoft Innovation Center Torino</a> (Italy).

I will present an introductory session about **Kinect for Windows**: how it works, its SDKs, the new SDK 1.7 features, and we'll see some basic samples. After my session, *"Take a Ticket* " game developers will live showcase their work.
