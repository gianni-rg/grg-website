**BEPS Engineering** will participate in "**Windows Embedded Workshops 2013**" events organized by **Avnet Embedded** & **Silica** in collaboration with **Freescale**.

*   **June 27, 2013** - **Milan**,
Italy
*   **June 28, 2013** - **Padua**,
Italy
*   **July 11, 2013** - **Rome**,
Italy

In these events, technical modular solutions that use multi-core processors from the *Freescale i.MX* family based on *ARM Cortex A9* will be presented.

Together with two of the largest producers of Italian SoM, **SECO** and **ENGICAM**, we will demonstrate application solutions both in terms of hardware and software. SECO, the market leader in SoM and Qseven solutions, will illustrate how to escape from the trap of custom passing through the revolution of the SOM. In particular, the development will be presented with i.MX6, emphasizing methods to reduce the Time-to-Market and the related risks/costs of a project. ENGICAM, thanks to the experience gained in SOM modules, will present solutions for applications such as marine, railway, automotive, motor control, display, mobility, Qt5, multitouch, gstreamer and realtime.

Hardware solutions will be integrated with software based on Microsoft Embedded CE/Compact and Linux.

To all the participants will be reserved for a special discount on hardware and software tools presented during the event, if purchased within 3 months from the event.
