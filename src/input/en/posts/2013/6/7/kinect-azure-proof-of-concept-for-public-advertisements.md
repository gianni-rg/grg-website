**Microsoft Innovation Center Torino**, **Arrow** and **BEPS Engineering** developed a proof-of-concept (POC) solution for *public advertisements*: **the Kinect-Azure POC**, an Intelligent Systems case study.

The current solution is focused on a real estate scenario, but the same technologies can be applied in different application domains.

The system is composed by three elements:

*   <div style="text-align: justify;">A *Kinect for Windows*
sensor which enables a Natural User Experience by means of simple
hand and body gestures</div>

*   <div style="text-align: justify;">A *Windows
Embedded*-powered device that runs the domain-specific
application, manages the Kinect device and connects to the
Cloud</div>

*   <div style="text-align: justify;">A powerful and flexible cloud
backend, leveraging the *Windows Azure* infrastructure,
which manages application contents and enables Business Intelligent
analysis.</div>

A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jxn6grNQ2I" target="_blank">short demo video</a> of the working solution is available on YouTube.
