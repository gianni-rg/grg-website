Yesterday all *BEPS Engineering* trainers attended a **Train The Trainer** course about **Windows Embedded 8 Standard** in *Microsoft France*, Paris.

The class was composed by a number of trainers from all over Europe, but BEPS people (in the photo, from left to right: *Marco*, *Salvatore*, *Dorangela*, *Gianni* and *Beppe*) counted for more than half of the class!

During the day we collected lots of useful information and material to teach the official Microsoft course about the new *Windows Embedded 8 Standard*.

Hope to see you soon in our next workshops!
