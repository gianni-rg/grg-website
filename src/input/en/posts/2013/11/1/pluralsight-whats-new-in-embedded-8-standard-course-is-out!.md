I'm very happy and proud to share that my first Pluralsight course has been published today: **<a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/whats-new-windows-embedded8-standard" target="_blank">What's new in Windows Embedded 8 Standard</a>**. Now I am truly a part of the Pluralsight team!

<span>The course provides an overview about the new features, tools and changes introduced in Windows Embedded 8 Standard, the successor of Windows Embedded Standard 7. Windows Embedded 8 Standard is a modular operating system based on Windows 8, which provides enterprises and device manufacturers the freedom to choose which capabilities will be part of their industry devices and intelligent system solutions. The newly released version supports modern, rich, customizable, multi-touch experiences that keep customers engaged and employees informed and productive, as well as new lock-down tools to ensure it's targeted, secure and consistent.</span>
