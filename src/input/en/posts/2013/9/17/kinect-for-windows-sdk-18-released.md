Today Microsoft released the new **Kinect for Windows SDK 1.8**, which includes some key features and samples that the community has been asking for, including:

*   **New background removal  

    ** An API removes the background behind the active user so
that it can be replaced with an artificial background. It is
especially useful for advertising, augmented reality gaming,
training and simulation, and other immersive experiences that place
the user in a different virtual environment.

*   **Realistic color capture with Kinect
Fusion**  

 A new Kinect Fusion API scans the color of the scene along with
the depth information so that it can capture the color of the
object along with its 3D model. The API also produces a texture map
for the mesh created from the scan. This feature provides an high
fidelity 3D model of a scan, including color, which can be used for
full color 3D printing or to create accurate 3D assets for games,
CAD and other applications.

*   **Improved tracking robustness with Kinect Fusion  

    ** This algorithm makes it easier to scan a scene. With this
update, Kinect Fusion is better able to maintain its lock on the
scene as the camera position moves.

*   **HTML interaction sample  

    ** This sample demonstrates implementing Kinect-enabled
buttons, simple user engagement and the use of a background removal
stream in HTML5. It allows developers to use HTML5 and JavaScript
to implement Kinect-enabled user interfaces, which was not possible
previously!

*   **Multiple-sensor Kinect Fusion sample  

    ** This sample shows developers how to use two sensors
simultaneously to scan a person or object from both sides, making
it possible to construct a 3D model without having to move the
sensor or the object! It demonstrates the calibration between two
Kinect for Windows sensors, and how to use Kinect Fusion APIs with
multiple depth snapshots. It is ideal for retail experiences and
other public kiosks that do not include having an attendant
available to scan by hand.

*   **Adaptive UI sample** **+ updated Human
Interface Guidelines**  

 This sample demonstrates how to build an application that adapts
itself depending on the distance between the user and the screen,
from gesturing at a distance to touching a touchscreen.
