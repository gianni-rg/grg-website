Yesterday Microsoft released a new version of the **Kinect for Windows SDK**.

It represents a significant update to the SDK since Microsoft released the first version a little over a year ago and, with the new features and enhancements introduced, new applications are now possible for businesses and developers. In addition to the updated SDK, a new and improved *Human Interface Guidelines* has been made available on Kinect <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/" target="_blank">website</a>. What's new:

*   <div style="text-align: justify;">**Kinect
Interactions** give businesses and developers the tools to
create intuitive, smooth and polished applications that are
ergonomic and intelligently based on the way people naturally move
and execute gestures. The interactions include *push-to-press
buttons*, *grip-to-pan capabilities,* "push" to select,
"grab" to scroll, wave to identify primary user and also support
two-user interactions. These new tools are based on thousands of
hours of research, development and testing with a broad and diverse
group of people, enabling businesses to quickly develop customized
and interesting solutions that address important business needs and
attract, engage and delight customers and people.</div>

*   <div style="text-align: justify;">**Kinect Fusion** is
one of the most affordable tools available today for creating
accurate 3D renderings of *people* and *objects*.
    *Kinect Fusion* fuses together multiple snapshots from the
Kinect sensor to create accurate 3D models. Developers can move a
Kinect sensor around a person, object or environment and "paint" a
3D image of the observed item in real-time. These 3D images can
then be used to enhance real-world scenarios: augmented reality, 3D
printing, industrial design and body scanning for things such as
improved clothes shopping experiences or medical usage.</div>

The updated SDK, *fully compatible* with all previous commercial releases, also ships an enhanced developer toolkit and additional developer resources, including:

*   **OpenCV and MATLAB Samples** to allow developers
to build advanced Kinect-enabled applications while using industry
standards
*   **Kinect for Windows Code Samples on CodePlex**,
marking the first time that select Kinect for Windows code samples
will be available through an open-source resource, enabling
existing and potential partners to explore and develop new
scenarios.
