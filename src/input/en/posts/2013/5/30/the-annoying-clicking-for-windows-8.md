<a href="http://annoyingclicking.nagylabs.com" target="_blank">The Annoying Clicking</a>, m<span>y new app for **Windows 8**,</span> is now available on the Windows Store!

It is an annoying, crazy, mind-breaking puzzle-game, based on a game design by an old friend of mine, Antony. He made the first version for Windows Phone last year, and we decided to port and adapt it for Windows 8, using *MonoGame* + XAML. Play alone or challenge your friends in 10 levels of gradually increasing difficulty, sometimes annoying... up to drive you crazy!
