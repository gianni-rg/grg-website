I am very happy to announce that I have been awarded for the 8th time in a row **Microsoft MVP** in the **Windows Development** category. Thank you to everyone in Microsoft (and non-Microsoft people) who made this possible again!

The Microsoft MVP Program is a worldwide award and recognition program that strives to identify amazing individuals in technical communities around the globe who share a passion for technology and the spirit of community. To become an MVP (*Most Valuable Professional*) candidates are nominated by Microsoft or other community members: they are rigorously evaluated for their technical expertise, community leadership and voluntary community contributions for the previous year. These individuals are chosen because they are exemplary community leaders who voluntarily share their passion and real-world knowledge of Microsoft products with others.

Congratulations to the other new and renewed *Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals* world-wide. Especially, I want to congratulate with my friends <a href="http://beppeplatania.com" target="_blank">Beppe Platania</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tinux80" target="_blank">Clemente Giorio</a>, who have been awarded again too!
