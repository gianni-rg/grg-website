On **September 26th** there will be the monthly <a href="http://www.torinotechnologiesgroup.it/" target="_blank">Torino Technologies Group</a> (TTG) meetup. We're hosted by <a href="http://www.toolboxoffice.it" target="_blank">Toolbox Coworking</a>, between 6PM and 8PM.

Meetup topic: **Fundamentals and use of IPv6 protocol in Windows environments**

The spread of the Internet and the proliferation of connected devices (smartphones, tablets, smartwatches) have brought to light the limits of IPv4, forcing providers and organizations to adopt a new version of the Internet Protocol called IPv6 in the near future. In the session, held by Ermanno Goletto and Roberto Massa, we will examine the fundamentals and functionalities of IPv6 from the point of view of the system administrator, examining the steps to be followed for its adoption, evaluating both the advantages and the problems to be addressed.

Registration is required <a href="https://www.eventbrite.it/e/biglietti-fondamenti-e-utilizzo-del-protocollo-ipv6-in-ambiente-windows-71642140571" target="_blank">**here**</a>.
