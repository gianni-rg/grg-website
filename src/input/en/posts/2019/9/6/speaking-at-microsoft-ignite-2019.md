Description: Hi all, I'm happy to announce that I've been selected as speaker at the Microsoft Ignite 2019 conference, in Orlando (FL, USA). The conference will take place on November 4-8, 2019. That's a great honour, and I'm very glad to be part of the speaker staff again, as did in Microsoft Ignite 2017 conference.

Hi all, I'm happy to announce that I've been selected as speaker at the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Ignite 2019 conference</a>, in Orlando, FL (USA). The conference will take place on **November 4-8, 2019**. That's a great honour, and I'm very glad to be part of the speaker staff again, as did in <a href="/en/posts/2017/08/29/speaking-at-microsoft-ignite-2017.html">Microsoft Ignite 2017 conference</a>.

This year I've been selected for 2 theater sessions. If you're at Microsoft Ignite, come to hear them!

* **Sport actions recognition in video using Deep Learning at scale**

    I will present a real-world experience in designing and developing custom Deep Learning models for detecting and classifying sport actions in videos. I will present the journey taken by <a href="https://www.deltatre.com" target="_blank">Deltatre's Innovation Lab team</a>, jointly with Microsoft CSE engineers and data scientists, from researching and prototyping models and approaches, datset preparation, performance optimization, up to a production-ready architecture and pipeline, for both model training and scoring.

* **Applied Deep Learning: new kind of multimedia content**

    I will describe new AI-based techniques to generate and enhance audio/video content, derived from <a href="https://www.deltatre.com" target="_blank">Deltatre's Innovation Lab team</a> experiments. Starting from some basic theory, will see some code, models and practical demos on new Deep Learning approaches able, for example, to slow down videos, increase quality/resolution, apply style-transfer, detect and track objects, faces and people.

Sessions scheduling is not available yet, but I will share it here, as soon as they are defined by Microsoft.

See you at Ignite.
