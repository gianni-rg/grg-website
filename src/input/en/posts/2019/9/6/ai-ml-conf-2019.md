I'd like to invite you to the <a href="https://aiconf.it/" target="_blank">**AI & ML Conference**</a>, in **Microsoft House, Milan (Italy)**, on **September 27th**.

This event, organized by <a href="https://www.aspitalia.com/" target="_blank">ASPItalia</a> and <a href="https://www.ugidotnet.org/" target="_blank">UGIdotNET</a> communities, was born from an idea by *Daniele Bochicchio*, *Francesco Diaz* and *Andrea Saltarello*, to bring Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning topics in a free Italian conference.

There will be Italian and international speakers, who will talk about everything needed to CTO, developers and data scientist to face today and tomorrow challenges.

In the specific, there will be the session **How to implement a custom Video Indexing service**, presented by me and **Clemente Giorio** (Microsoft Windows Development MVP), where we'll present our experience in the <a href="https://www.deltatre.com" target="_blank">Deltatre's Innovation Lab</a>, about how to develop a custom Video Indexer, to be used when commercial services by main providers are not enough or too much "general purpose".

The event is free, but registration is required <a href="https://www.eventbrite.it/e/biglietti-ai-ml-conference-64531878586" target="_blank">here</a>.
