Hello, I'd like to invite you to the next **Coding Gym Torino**, the meeting will be on **September 16th at 19PM in <a href="http://www.toolboxoffice.it/" target="_blank">Toolbox</a>**. Also this month we'll host the training session **on Monday evening**, together with our friends of <a href="https://www.toolboxoffice.it/eventi/coding-for-everyone-2019-09-16/" target="_blank">Coding For Everyone</a>.

If you don't know it yet, Coding Gym is an international *free* programming lab format open to any language and developed for continuous improvement. **It is not a course** but sessions are arranged and moderated by one or more **trainer**, where attendees ("**gymmers**") work in pair on **2 or 3 self-contained challenges**, using *any programming language* they agree upon. Everything is done in the web browser, so no need to have SDK or dev tools on your machine (but you can, if you want!).

For more information, please visit <a href="https://coding-gym.org/" target="_blank">the official website</a>.

Slots are limited and **<a href="https://coding-gym-to0919.eventbrite.it/" target="_blank">registration</a> is required**.

See you soon in the Lab!
