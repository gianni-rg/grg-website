In the last months I've been involved in a number of web and cloud-related projects both at work and in my spare time, where I learnt a lot of cool stuff about web development, HTML5, Javascript and CSS3: I decided to certify my achievements, and today I passed the new **70-480** (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?id=70-480" target="_blank">Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3</a>) exam, first step in the web development certification path (*MCSD: Web Applications* or *MCSD: Windows Store Apps using HTML5*). You can get your certifications by scheduling an exams in a <a href="https://www.prometric.com/en-us/Pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">Prometric Testing Center</a>.
