As announced, today Microsoft released the *<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35471" target="_blank">Windows Phone 8 SDK</a>*!

It consists of a full-featured development environment to use for building apps and games for **Windows Phone 8.0** *<span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span>* **Windows Phone 7.5**. The Windows Phone SDK provides a stand-alone Visual Studio Express 2012 Edition for Windows Phone or works as an add-in to Visual Studio 2012 Professional, Premium or Ultimate.

With the SDK, it is possible to use levearage existing programming skills and code to build managed or *native* code apps. In addition, the SDK includes multiple emulators and additional tools for profiling and testing your Windows Phone app under real-world conditions.

To run the emulator *Windows 8 Pro x64 edition* and *a processor that supports Second Level Address Translation* (SLAT) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are required</span>. If a computer does not meet the requirements for the Windows Phone 8 Emulator, the SDK will install and run, however the Windows Phone 8 Emulator will not work and developers won't be able to deploy or test apps *on the Emulator*.
