Yesterday Microsoft officially launched **Windows Phone 8**. We already knew a lot of the new features and capabilities of the new OS, but a number of them have been introduced just at the keynote in San Francisco:

*   **Live Apps** *(Lock Screen
notifications*)  

 Microsoft has added the ability to set any app that uses push
notifications to notify you straight to the lock screen from where
you can unlock direct to that app.  

*   **Kid's Corner  

    ** A rather nice and unique feature here from Microsoft.
There's a tile on the Start Screen called "*Kid's Corner*".
Tap this and it will take you to a virtual Start Screen that
children can build themselves and customise with apps and games and
whatever else they'd like to do with their parents' phone. At the
same time, parents choose what is available to them and protect
those options with a PIN.  

*   **OneNote Mobile  

    ** OneNote Mobile is not under the Office Hub section
anymore. That's because it has now been moved out and has become an
app in its own right on the Start Screen. The idea is that it gives
users instant access to note taking which now sync automatically
with SkyDrive. It's also quick to share photos with OneNote now.
Tap and hold on an image and select the OneNote option.  

*   **Data Sense**  

 Microsoft added a handy new app for those on sensitive data plans.
"*Data Sense"* keeps a track of user's data usage. It is
possible to set how much data one has in his contract and on which
day of the month the counter can be reset. If users do get close to
their ceilings, then "*Data Sense*" will send a
warning.

And last, but not least, today the *Windows Phone 8 SDK* should be made publicly available. Stay tuned for updates!
