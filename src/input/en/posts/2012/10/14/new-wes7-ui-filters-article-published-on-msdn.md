This is just a bookmark to the great article about **<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/it-it/library/jj714812.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Embedded Standard 7 UI Filters</a>**, written by Windows Embedded MVP **Beppe Platania**. Together with my colleague **Marina Sabetta**, I've been the *technical reviewer* of the article. It has been published in Italian on Microsoft MSDN, but the same contents are available in English on <a href="http://beppeplatania.cloudapp.net" target="_blank">Beppe's blog</a>.

If you missed it, it is also available another interesting article by Beppe, about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/it-it/library/hh925629.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Embedded Standard 7 SP1 Keyboard Filter</a> (in English on Beppe's blog).
