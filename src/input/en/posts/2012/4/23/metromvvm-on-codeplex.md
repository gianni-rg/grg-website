**MetroMVVM** is a .NET helper library for *Windows 8 Metro style XAML applications*. It contains a set of basic components, helpers and extensions to easily develop apps based on the Model-View-ViewModel pattern. The goal of this library is to make Windows 8 XAML apps development faster, using a widely adopted pattern and a decoupled architecture, so developers won't have to spend time solving problems that have already been solved.

The library is based on other existing MVVM frameworks (<a href="http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com" target="_blank">MVVM Light Toolkit</a>, <a href="http://mvvmfoundation.codeplex.com" target="_blank">MVVM Foundation</a>) and extends and integrates them with personal and other developers' contributions (<a href="http://www.xamlplayground.org" target="_blank">Andrea Boschin</a>, <a href="http://timheuer.com/blog" target="_blank">Tim Heuer</a>, <a href="http://blog.humann.info/" target="_blank">Nicolas Humann</a>, <a href="http://blog.roboblob.com" target="_blank">Slobodan Pavkov</a>, <a href="http://dotnetbyexample.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Joost van Schaik</a>), in order to be proficiently used to develop rich-featured and complex apps targeted to *Windows 8 Consumer Preview*.

I'm currently developing some Metro-style apps and the helper library is an in-progress side-by-side project, which I'll update periodically to integrate features and enhancements as soon as I develop them.

Future posts will cover **MetroMVVM** architecture, components, usages and samples. For now, <a href="http://metromvvm.codeplex.com" target="_blank">download it from CodePlex</a> and give it a try. Please, feel free to send me comments, advices or bug reports!
