Few days ago an updated version of *Expression Blend Preview for Silverlight 5* has been released (download it from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=9503" target="_blank">here</a>). It provides support for creating **Silverlight 5** and **Silverlight 5 SketchFlow** projects <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> (for previous version of Silverlight or to design WPF applications, Expression Blend 4 *is required*).

This release can be installed side-by-side with Expression Blend 4 and it's *identical* to the previously released *Expression Blend Preview for Silverlight 5.* It contains just three changes:

*   The expiration date has been extended to *June 30,
2013*.
*   It contains a go-live license that allows designer/developers
to distribute the software created with this release
*   Silverlight 5 SDK that is installed with Blend has been updated
to Silverlight 5 RTM.

Before installing this release, any previous version of *Blend Preview for Silverlight 5* (or *Blend SDK Preview for Silverlight 5*) must be removed.
