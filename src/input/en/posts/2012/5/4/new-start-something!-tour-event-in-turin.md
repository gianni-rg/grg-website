On **June 15th** there will be a new **<a href="http://communitydevtool.com/public/frmdetailevent.aspx?eventid=0403GIGIKPSHKPJGGIISLP" target="_blank">Start Something! Tour</a>** event in Turin, hosted and organized by Microsoft, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.torinotechnologiesgroup.it/Home.aspx" target="_blank">TTG - Torino Technologies Group</a> community. As did in the previous event held in March, it will be an open day for people who want to write and test their applications on *Windows Phone devices* (in collaboration with Nokia) or Series 5/Series 7 Tablets and Notebooks with *Windows 8* (in collaboration with Samsung).

My colleague Marco and I will be lab assistants to the workshop held by **Lorenzo Barbieri**, *Italian Windows 8 and Windows Phone Developer Evangelist*.
