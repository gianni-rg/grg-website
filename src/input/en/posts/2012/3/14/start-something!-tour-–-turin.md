Tomorrow and on Friday I'll be at the **<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/italy/archive/2012/02/20/start-something-tour-le-prime-tappe-online.aspx" target="_blank">Start Something! Tour</a>** in Turin, hosted and organized by Microsoft, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.torinotechnologiesgroup.it/Home.aspx" target="_blank">TTG - Torino Technologies Group</a> community. They will be two open days for people who want to write and test their applications on *Windows Phone devices* (in collaboration with Nokia) or Series 5/Series 7 Tablets and Notebooks with *Windows 8* (in collaboration with Samsung).

My colleague Marco and I will be lab assistants to the workshop held by **Lorenzo Barbieri**, *Italian Windows 8 and Windows Phone Developer Evangelist*.

At the end of the day there will also be the <a href="http://www.torinotechnologiesgroup.it/eventi/12-02-18/Incontro_community_15_marzo_2012.aspx" target="_blank">TTG community monthly meeting</a>, dedicated to "**Developing Applications with Windows 8**".
