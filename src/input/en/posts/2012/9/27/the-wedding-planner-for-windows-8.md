I'm very happy to announce that my first Windows 8 app, "**The Wedding Planner**", is now available on the Windows Store, *for free*.

It has been a long journey, since the first designing phases to publishing the app on the Store, few days ago. Everything started on the *Windows 8 Consumer Preview* in March. Then, back in June, the preliminary version of the app had been admitted in the <a href="http://w8apps.cloudapp.net/" target="_blank">Italian "Windows 8 Hall of Fame"</a>, along with other great apps by friends and fellow developers. This summer, among other projects (and a few Certification Exams about the new Microsoft development technologies), I completed the porting to the *Windows 8 Release Preview* and then, during the last weeks, I finished all the development on *Windows 8 RTM*.

I've also been able to integrate some preliminary versions of the *DatePicker* control included in the amazing <a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/windows-metro/overview.aspx" target="_blank">Telerik's RadControls for Metro</a> suite, also reporting a few bugs to the Telerik team, who fixed them immediately. As secondary project, I started the development of **MetroMVVM**, an helper library for MVVM support in Windows Store applications (a.k.a Metro-style apps): it's available on <a href="http://metromvvm.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Codeplex</a>.

I've learned a lot of new things and had a fantastic Windows 8 experience, so far. *If you haven't tried it yet, what are you waiting for?*

At last, I'd like to thank *<a href="https://twitter.com/_geniodelmale" target="_blank">Lorenzo Barbieri</a>*, Italian *Microsoft Technical Evangelist*, and the Microsoft DPE team, for they support throughout the app development, especially in the *Excellence Lab* experience.
