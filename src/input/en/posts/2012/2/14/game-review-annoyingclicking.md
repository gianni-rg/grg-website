Description: An amazing and mind-breaking game to spend your idle times simple designed, but really hard to play. It's just a tapping game where you have to rapidly decide whether you have to tap on the left half of the screen or on the right one, depending on the colors you see on the screen itself. Easy, isn't it? Well

If you try it, you'll see that in the end it becomes very challenging: the more you fail, the more you get annoyed (or angry), bringing your mind in a vicious circle where you will fail again and again, and get more and more annoyed (or angry).

If you like mind challenges, this game will train your mind and let you have some fun at the same time. What are you waiting for!?
