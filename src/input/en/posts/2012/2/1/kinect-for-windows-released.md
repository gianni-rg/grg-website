The official **Kinect for Windows** SDK has been officially released today.

Alongside with the SDK, a new sensor is available. The newly released hardware is optimized for use with computers and devices running Windows 7, Windows 8 developer preview (*desktop applications only*), and Windows Embedded-based devices. If you want to buy it, you can go there: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/purchase/" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/purchase/</a>

New features (*for a Kinect for Windows sensor, not the Xbox 360 one!*):

* **Commercial license**.
Now, using a Kinect for Windows sensor and the official SDK, you can develop commercial applications powered by Kinect technologies.

* **Enhanced sensor capabilities**.
The new sensor offers a **Near Mode** field of view, which enables the depth camera to see objects as close as 40 centimeters in front of the sensor. In addition, it is possible to plug up to 4 Kinect sensors into the same computer.

* **SDK improvements**.
The Windows SDK offers *an improved skeletal tracking*, which enables developers to control which user is being tracked by the sensor, and *the latest Microsoft Speech components* with improved speech recognition accuracy. In addition, API consistency and ease of development have been enhanced.

* **Raw sensors streams**.
Added support for both *Default* and *Near* modes and also give more information about depth values outside the range than was previously available. There is also improved synchronization between color and depth, mapping depth to color, and a full frame API.

New features can be used **only** with the new *Kinect for Windows* sensor, but it is still possible to develop with the Xbox 360 sensor. Anyway, it is advisable, in case you are developing a commercial product, to switch to the new hardware as soon as possible.
