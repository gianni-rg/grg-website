manifacturers
*   for developers, *new SDK later this summer*
*   multi-core support (2 or 4 cores)
*   multiple screen resolutions (WVGA 800x480, WXGA 1280x768, 720p
1280x720)
*   *Shared Windows Core*: Windows 8 Kernel and common
desktop sub-systems (drivers, security, multimedia)
*   Full Windows Phone 7.5 app compatibility
*   Removable microSD storage
*   Visual Studio 2012 for Windows Phone 7.5 and Windows Phone 8
app development
*   *Native* code development (C/C++ and DirectX 11 - for
great gaming and multimedia applications)
*   XAML C#/VB.NET with *full* .NET Framework support on
mobile devices
*   IE10 browser (common code-base, including SmartScreen
anti-pishing) and Web Control for 3rd party apps (HTML5, optimized
Javascript engine)
*   Integrated NFC support (sharing, device to device
communication, credit/debit cards, membership cards, etc.)

launch)

Unfortunately, current existing devices WILL NOT BE UPDATABLE to Windows Phone 8. Microsoft will release *an updated Windows Phone 7 OS version* (called Windows Phone 7.8) which will bring a similar User Experience, but which will not leverage all the new hardware stuff.

Stay tuned for other news and updates in the next months!
