A few days ago I've entered the Italian "<a href="http://w8apps.cloudapp.net/">Windows 8 App Hall of Fame</a>", for being one of the first Italian developers who developed a Windows 8 Metro-style app, along with other great dev fellows. The app is "*The Wedding Planner*" and will be soon available on the Windows Store (when it will open). You can imagine what its purpose is.

Do you want to be part of the *Windows 8 Hall Of Fame*? Tell about your app to <a href="mailto:itamsdn@microsoft.com" target="_blank">MSDN Italy</a>, they will contact you for further evaluations. If you wish to learn how to develop for Windows 8, you can participate to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/italy/technolandia/" target="_blank">Start Something! Tour</a> labs.
