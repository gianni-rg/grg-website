Some days ago Microsoft shared with the world a detailed roadmap about its upcoming Windows Embedded products.

The most interesting update is that a new version of **Windows Embedded Handheld** is coming. Microsoft hasn't released a new version of this operating system since it delivered *Windows Embedded Handheld 6.5* (based on the Windows Mobile 6.5), back in July 2010. *Windows Embedded 8 Handheld* - about which "more information will be available in early 2013" - is going to be based on *Windows Phone 8* technologies. This will be a product for the ruggedized/enterprise handheld device market.

The other Windows Embedded products:

*   <div style="text-align: justify;">**Windows Embedded 8
Standard**, which is based on the Windows 8 core code. A
release preview is available now; general availability is planned
for March 2013.</div>

*   <div style="text-align: justify;">**Windows Embedded 8
Pro**, which also is based on the Windows 8 core. This is
the new name for the product formerly known as *Windows Embedded
8 Enterprise*. General availability is scheduled for March
    2013.</div>

*   <div style="text-align: justify;">**Windows Embedded 8
Industry** is the *renamed* Windows Embedded POSReady
(with POS standing for "point of sale"). There will be both a
community technology preview test build and details on timing
coming at the beginning of 2013.</div>

*   <div style="text-align: justify;">**Windows Embedded Compact
2013** is the new name for the product that until now seemed
destined to be known as *Windows Embedded 8 Compact*.

available in the second quarter of 2013.</div>
