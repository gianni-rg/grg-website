I'm really happy for being showcased in the official <a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/windows-8/showcases.aspx" target="_blank">Telerik's Windows 8 apps gallery</a>, together with other 9 apps.

My app "*The Wedding Planner*" leverages the great **RadControls for Windows 8** from Telerik since their early beta versions. In details, I adopted the *XAML DatePicker*, which enables users to input dates through a looping-list picker, similarly to Windows Phone one.

If you are building Windows 8 apps, <a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/windows-8/overview.aspx" target="_blank">try Telerik's RadControls for Windows 8</a>, they're are currently available at a special launch price! And don't forget the other great Telerik's tools, like **JustCode**, **JustMock** and **JustTrace**. Really helpful in everyday developer's life.
