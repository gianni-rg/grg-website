Description: It's been an amazing day! Today, winners of the Phase 1 of the OpenCV AI Competition 2021 have been announced, and my team (composed by Clemente Giorio and me) has been selected! That was an incredible news, given that there have been more than 1400 submissions world-wide and only 258 teams got promoted to the next phase. Congratulations to all the Phase 1 winners, and good luck for the next phase!

It's been an amazing day! Today, winners of the Phase 1 of the <a href="https://opencv.org/opencv-ai-competition-2021/" target="_blank">OpenCV AI Competition 2021</a> have been announced, and my team **IDLE - Image Deep Learning Enthusiasts** (composed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clemente-giorio-03a61811/" target="_blank">Clemente Giorio</a> and me) has been selected! That was an incredible news, given that there have been more than 1400 submissions world-wide and only 258 teams got promoted to the next phase. Congratulations to all the <a href="https://opencv.org/opencv-ai-competition-2021/#phase1-winners-list" target="_blank">Phase 1 winners</a>, and good luck for the next phase!

Supported by sponsors (**Intel** and **Microsoft**), all Phase 1 winners will receive <a href="https://vimeo.com/483053264" target="_blank">**OpenCV OAK-D devices**</a> to help them build their projects during Phase 2. An OAK-D Device is a variant of the OpenCV AI Kit (OAK) capable of Spatial AI, the capability for AI to be applied to the physical world – to tell you what an object is and where it is in 3D space – in real time. It does this by running object detection off of its integrated 12MP RGB camera and combining the results with its integrated stereo-depth engine. You can run a variety of deep learning models support by OpenVINO and OAK-D automatically augments them with spatial data from the integrated stereo depth engine. A very interesting device!

We'll share our project's development journey on this blog and on our social channels. Stay tuned for more information and updates in the upcoming weeks.
