Description: Hi all, I'm honored again to have been selected as speaker for Codemotion Online 2021 (Italian Edition). I will co-present a session about MLOps with Azure Machine Learning and Kubeflow, with Clemente Giorio, my colleague in Deltatre and Microsoft MVP, and Vito Flavio Lorusso from Microsoft. We'll share our experience in applying DevOps to Machine Learning projects, from prototypes to production, with Azure Machine Learning, Kubeflow and other open-source tools and frameworks. That's a great honour, and I'm very glad to be part of the speaker staff again, as did in previous Codemotion editions.
