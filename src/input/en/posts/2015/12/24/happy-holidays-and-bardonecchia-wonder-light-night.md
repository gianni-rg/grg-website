We're arrived to the end of this amazing and interesting 2015. It is time for some short relax with friends and families and experiment with cool new technological gadgets. I wish you a Merry Christmas (or an happy 25th Dec, if you don't celebrate) and a great Happy New Year!

To celebrate the starting of 2016, I'd like to invite you to the <span>**Bardonecchia Wonder Light Night** event, on **January 4th, 2016, from 5.30PM**.</span> <span>*Bardonecchia Wonder Light Night* is an exhibition about innovation and entertainment that will be held in the central plaza of Bardonecchia (Piazza De Gasperi). If you don't know where Bardonecchia is… well, it is here:</span>
