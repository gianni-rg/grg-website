I'm very happy to announce that my third Pluralsight course has been published early today:**<a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/augmented-reality-android-devices-getting-started" target="_blank">Getting Started with Augmented Reality on Android devices</a>**.

<a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/augmented-reality-android-devices-getting-started" target="_blank"></a>Last year, most of my daily work consisted of analyzing and developing a number of Augmented Reality projects on the Android platform, using Google Glass and Android Wear devices. Used to Windows Phone and its development environment and tools, I had a big paradigm shift and learning curve, which gave me the idea to create this getting started course, for people like me who want to start from scratch developing Augmented Reality applications.

This course introduces Android developers to Augmented Reality concepts and applications. AR apps are already available on smartphones and tablets, but in the next months and years, with the wide adoption of smart-glasses, they will redefine our lives, by blending the physical world with virtual worlds and shifting applications from our device screens directly to our eyes. Starting from the theory, hands-on examples will enable students to quickly develop and deploy amazing Augmented Reality applications, either using low-level algorithms or leveraging high-quality AR frameworks.

I'm willing to know what you think about it and, for any question, feel free to contact me!
