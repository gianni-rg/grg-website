As usual since the past years, a new appointment with the Embedded world returns to Naples (Italy): the "Microsoft Embedded Conference", which changed name to **"Internet of Things Conference"**.

The free event will be on **Saturday, April 18th 2015 in Naples (Italy)**, organized by <a href="http://www.dotnetcampania.org/" target="_blank">DotNetCampania</a> community and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/it-it/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> Italy. It will be about *Internet of Things* and all related technologies, from micro-devices to the cloud, passing through *wearables* and other technologies.

As in the past years, there will be all the Italian Microsoft Windows Embedded MVPs. In addition, there will also be Erica Barone, Technical Evangelist in *Microsoft Italy*, and Olivier Bloch, well-known Technical Evangelist in *Microsoft Open Technologies*, with a live remote session from Redmond.

I will be there, together with <a href="http://beppeplatania.com/it" target="_blank">Beppe Platania</a>, and we'll present a session about IoT theory and practice: we'll have an overview about the "usual" Windows Embedded systems and then we'll move on to the latest IoT services available in Azure. We'll also see how the IoT is moving from the Industrial world to the people, with augmented/virtual reality devices and wearable sensors. You can't miss it!
