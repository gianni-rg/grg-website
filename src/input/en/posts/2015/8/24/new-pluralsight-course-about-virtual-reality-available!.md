I'm happy to announce that my new Pluralsight/Digital Tutors course is finally available: **<a href="http://www.digitaltutors.com/tutorial/2227-Getting-Started-with-VR-in-Unity" target="_blank">Getting Started with Virtual Reality in Unity</a>**.

<a href="http://www.digitaltutors.com/tutorial/2227-Getting-Started-with-VR-in-Unity" target="_blank"></a>Since last year my daily work consisted of analyzing and developing **Virtual Reality** projects with *Oculus Rift* for Windows and *Samsung Gear VR* for Android using *Unity 3D*. Used to IoT/Windows Embedded programming and its development tools, I had a big paradigm shift and learning curve, which gave me the idea to produce this getting started course, for people like me who want to start from scratch understanding Virtual Reality and developing immersive applications.

<span>In this course, you will learn the fundamentals for building virtual reality games and applications targeted to the **Oculus Rift** and **Samsung Gear VR**. </span> <span>You will see what the Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR are, how they work and then you'll see how easy it easy to start creating immersive experiences for both desktop and smartphones. You will also learn where to start when implementing VR natural user interfaces by leveraging a **Leap Motion** device for hands and fingers tracking. </span> <span>By the end of this training, you'll have a firm grasp on the tools, techniques and workflows needed to create your own VR games and apps.</span>..

I'm willing to know what you think about it and, for any question, feel free to contact me!
