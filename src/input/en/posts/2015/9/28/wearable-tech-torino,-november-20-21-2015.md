I'm glad to announce that **<a href="http://www.immotionar.com" target="_blank">ImmotionAR</a> will be at the WTT (Wearable Tech Torino) here in Turin, on November 20-21! ** WTT is the first exhibition in Italy (and maybe in Europe) dedicated completely to wearable technologies. You can find more information at this link <a href="http://www.wearabletechtorino.com/en/" target="_blank">http://www.wearabletechtorino.com/</a>.

**We're working very hard to take there our solution for wandering in virtual worlds, wearing nothing but a VR headset**<span>. We made a prototype of our solution some months ago: if you haven't seen it yet check this link </span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2DrXta2Vk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2DrXta2Vk</a> <span>.</span>

<span>Hope to see you there!</span>
