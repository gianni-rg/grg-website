*Overnet*, in collaboration with Microsoft, organizes **WPC 2015** **on** **December 1st and 2nd**, in *Milano* (*Italy*). WPC is the most important Italian conference about Microsoft technologies: it is a 2 full-days event about news and updates with more than 70 sessions divided in 8 tracks. By coming to WPC, you will be able to discover and learn the present and the future of software development technologies and IT solutions and, the most important aspect, meet and talk with experts.
