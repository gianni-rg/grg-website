Last announcement of the day, on **November 22nd** there will be the monthly <a href="http://www.torinotechnologiesgroup.it/" target="_blank">Torino Technologies Group</a> (TTG) meetup. **We changed the place**, now we're hosted by <a href="http://www.toolboxoffice.it" target="_blank">Toolbox Coworking</a>, but still between 6PM and 8PM.

Together with me and Fabrizio Accatino, we'll see what Microsoft presented in the past months, starting from **Azure DevOps**, to  what's new in **.NET Core**, **ML.NET**, **Xamarin** and much more. Thanks to Microsoft, attendess will receive some themed gadgets (as long as available).
