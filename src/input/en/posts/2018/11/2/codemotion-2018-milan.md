Today is a day of announcements. After the traditional appointment with WPC, I'd like to highlight you another important tech conference, **<a href="https://milan2018.codemotionworld.com/" target="_blank">Codemotion Milan 2018</a>**, **on November 29th and 30th**. The <a href="https://milan2018.codemotionworld.com/conference/" target="_blank">agenda is available online</a>: a lot of contents and speakers from all over ther world.

This year I have the opportunity to be speaker, with a session about <a href="https://milan2018.codemotionworld.com/talk-detail/?detail=9341" target="_blank">**Artificial Intelligence applied to a multimedia sport platform (OTT)**</a>. We'll see where and how Deltatre, a global leader for sport business services, is early-adopting AI techs in their world-class, multi-device OTT (*over-the-top*) platform services, powering some of the major sport federations, such as NFL Game Pass, ATP Tennis TV and FINA FINAtv. Based on Microsoft cloud services, 3rd party providers and custom ML models built with open-source libraries and frameworks, the session shows how AI is helping to achieve better system monitoring, improved customer support, more fan engagement and per-user customization in on-demand and live streaming.
