I'd like to invite you to the traditional yearly appointment with **<a href="https://www.wpc2018.it/cms/it-IT/Home" target="_blank">WPC 2018</a>**, the main Italian conference about Microsoft technologies. This is the 25th edition, organized in Milan (Italy) **from November 27th to November 29th** by OverNet Education. The <a href="https://www.wpc2018.it/cms/it-IT/Sessioni" target="_blank">session list</a> is ready and available online: also this year, it is very rich with sessions about dev tools, AI, web/app developement and Mixed Reality.

I'm glad to be speaker also this year, with a session about **Artificial Intelligence applied to a multimedia sport platform (OTT)**. We'll see where and how Deltatre, a global leader for sport business services, is early-adopting AI techs in their world-class, multi-device OTT (*over-the-top*) platform services, powering some of the major sport federations, such as NFL Game Pass, ATP Tennis TV and FINA FINAtv. Based on Azure AI services, 3rd party providers and custom models built with open-source libraries and frameworks, the session shows how AI is helping to achieve better system monitoring, improved customer support, more fan engagement and per-user customization in on-demand and live streaming.
