Hi all. Following the announcement *at //Build* at the beginning of May, I'd like to highlight you the **<a href="https://insiderdevtour.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Insider Dev Tour</a>**, a world-wide initiative in major cities, including **Milan** and **Rome**, in Italy, on **June  12th and 14th, 2018**.

*The Insider Dev Tour is for developers interested in building Microsoft experiences today, using the latest developer technologies, as well as for those who want a peek into the future. If you can read code, this is for you, regardless if you are a beginner, expert, student, or hobbyist developer!*

Events will be free and with about the same agenda (during a whole day, different topics will be covered, including Win32/XAML apps, PWAs, Azure, Windows, Office, AI/Machine Learning and Mixed Reality).

I'll be one of the speaker in *Milan*, together with other friends from Microsoft and MVP experts. 

To participate*, registration is required*. Here are the links for both events:
