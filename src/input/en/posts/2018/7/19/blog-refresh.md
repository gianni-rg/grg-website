After many years of the good old Metro UI style, inspired by Windows Phone, I decided to give this blog a refresh and also change the underlaying blog engine.

After reading about **static websites** in <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/ExploringWyamANETStaticSiteContentGenerator.aspx" target="_blank">this old post by Scott Hanselman</a>, I decided to experimenting a little bit with <a href="https://wyam.io/" target="_blank">**Wyam**</a>, a highly modular and configurable .NET static site content generator, and results are quite satisfying!

Predefined blog templates in Wyam do not support multi-language features built-in, so I had to develop and customize some components to obtain the desired results. Also, I developed a tool to export (and convert to Markdown) all the existing content from the previous blog version (based on <a href="https://umbraco.com/" target="_blank">Umbraco CMS</a>).

I'll share all the details in an upcoming post series and all the source code will be available soon, in case you may need something similar for a project of yours.
