Welcome back from Holidays (if you did them)! To refresh your minds and improve your coding and algorithm skills, I'd like to invite you to **Coding Gym Torino**, a new kind of free events I'm organizing in Turin (Italy) with the help of some collaborators.

Coding Gym is an international programming lab format open to any language and developed for continuous improvement.
Attendees ("**gymmers**") work in pair on **3 self-contained challenges**, using *any programming language* they agree upon. Everything is done in the web browser, so no need to have SDK or dev tools on your machine.

Coding Gym **is not a course** but it is arranged and moderated by one or more **trainer**. After each challenge, the Coding Gym *trainer* opens a discussion and facilitates a **retrospective**: *gymmers* are encouraged to show solutions they have found. Each solution comes with discussing and understanding pros, cons and tradeoffs. Moreover, the trainer could share new solutions and concepts, and could ask *gymmers* to discuss about requirements change. For instance, "*what happens if the input of the problem grows by 100 times?*", or "*can you solve the problem without allocating extra space?*" Sometimes varying the problem comes with new opportunities to simplify or complicate the solutions.

For more information, please visit <a href="https://coding-gym.org/" target="_blank">the official website</a>.

**Coding Gym events are free**. The first one will be on **September 29th** at <a href="http://www.toolboxoffice.it/en/" target="_blank">Toolbox</a>.\
Slots are limited and **<a href="https://coding-gym-to0918.eventbrite.it/" target="_blank">registration</a> is required**.

See you soon in the lab!
