Hello, I'd like to invite to the next monthly <a href="http://www.torinotechnologiesgroup.it/" target="_blank">Torino Technologies Group</a> (TTG) meetup, on **December 13th**, hosted by <a href="http://www.toolboxoffice.it" target="_blank">Toolbox Coworking</a>, between 6PM and 8PM.

In modern IT infrastructures the management of digital certificates is one of the activities that underlie a correct information security policy. In the first part of the session, **Roberto Massa (Microsoft MVP)** will analyze the setup architectures for a *Cerification Authority in Windows Server* for small, medium and large companies and will discuss the best practices for managing Security and Backup of a CA. In the second part, on the other hand, he will show us to use the free *Let's Encrypt* Public Certification Authority for the automated management of the life cycle of digital certificates.

Registration is required <a href="https://www.eventbrite.it/e/biglietti-public-key-infrastructure-windows-e-lets-encrypt-53009289211" target="_blank">**here**</a>.
