Hello all, I'd like to share with you that the next **Coding Gym Torino** meeting will be on **December 15th, at 10:30AM in <a href="http://www.toolboxoffice.it/" target="_blank">Toolbox</a>**.

If you don't know it yet, Coding Gym is an international *free* programming lab format open to any language and developed for continuous improvement. **It is not a course** but sessions are arranged and moderated by one or more **trainer**, where attendees ("**gymmers**") work in pair on **3 self-contained challenges**, using *any programming language* they agree upon. Everything is done in the web browser, so no need to have SDK or dev tools on your machine (but you can, if you want!).

For more information, please visit <a href="https://coding-gym.org/" target="_blank">the official website</a>.

Slots are limited and **<a href="https://coding-gym-to1218.eventbrite.it/" target="_blank">registration</a> is required**.

This time I won't be in the lab, because I'll present a session at the upcoming **<a href="/en/posts/2018/12/06/global-ai-mr-bootcamp-2018-milan.html">Microsoft Global AI/MR Bootcamp</a>** in Milan, but *Beppe Platania* and *Riccardo Magliocchetti* will help you in the last training of 2018.
