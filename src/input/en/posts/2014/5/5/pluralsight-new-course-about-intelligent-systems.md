I'm very happy to announce that my second Pluralsight course has been published today:**<a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/building-intelligent-system-embedded-to-cloud" target="_blank">Building an Intelligent System: From Embedded to Cloud</a>**.

<span>This course is an advanced journey in the developing phases of an Intelligent System, using Windows Embedded 8.1 Industry and Microsoft Azure. After a brief introduction to the Internet of Things concept, we'll see how a real word intelligent system can be built, starting from requirements and specifications, passing through configuration, services, management, cloud backend, and communication strategies, up to the final deploy.</span>

Let me know what you think about it and, for any question, feel free to write me an e-mail!
