On **February 15th, 2014** in Naples, Italy, there will be the second <a href="http://www.microsoftembeddedconference.it/">Microsoft Embedded Conference</a>. The free full-day event is organized by the cultural association <a href="http://dotnetcampania.org/">DotNetCampania</a> and his community.

This year, the focus will be on **the** **Internet Of Things** and **M2M Communications**, the top trending topics of 2014. We'll see how Microsoft technologies can be used to design and integrate such solutions, called "Intelligent Systems". These are always online and cloud inter-connected systems.

**<a href="http://beppeplatania.com" target="_blank">Beppe Platania</a> ** and me will participate as speakers and we'll present **Sense3**: *an Embedded+cloud solution for Showrooms, events and Entertainment*.

All the details about the session and logistics are available on the official website: <a href="http://mec2014.dotnetcampania.org/" target="_blank" title="http://mec2014.dotnetcampania.org/">http://mec2014.dotnetcampania.org/</a>.

It will be a great event for all embedded hobbyists and professionals. See you in Naples on February 15th.
