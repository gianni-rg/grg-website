Description: Together with the organizers and the UGIdotNET community, I'd like to invite you to the next live episode of Small Talks, Generative AI - A look into open-source models and toolkits, Thursday, May 4th, at 5PM (CET). We will talk about generative AI, in Italian, and I will try to share my experience in some of its application scenarios. We will look at lesser-known models, frameworks, and tools that are open-source and, above all, that can be used to make the most of local resources on any PC, with or without a GPU, thanks to ONNX Runtime, Intel OpenVINO, and NVIDIA technologies.
