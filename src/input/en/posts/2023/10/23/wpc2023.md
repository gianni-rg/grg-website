I am pleased to invite you to the annual event **<a href="https://www.wpc.education/?mtm_campaign=WPC_2023&mtm_kwd=Speaker&mtm_source=Social_MVP&mtm_content=giannirosagallina" target="_blank">WPC 2023</a>**, the main Italian conference on *Microsoft* technologies. Organized in Milan (Italy) **from November 28th to November 30th** by **OverNet Education**. The <a href="https://www.wpc.education/speakers?mtm_campaign=WPC_2023&mtm_kwd=Speaker&mtm_source=Social_MVP&mtm_content=giannirosagallina" target="_blank">list of speakers and sessions</a> is available online: this year, it is once again very rich, featuring numerous sessions on artificial intelligence, web development, app development, the latest updates on development tools, and many other topics!

Together with my dear friend **[Clemente Giorio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clemente-giorio-03a61811/)** (Microsoft MVP, Intel Innovator), we will be speakers in the *Artificial Intelligence* track, with the session **Implementing Generative AI leveraging open-source models** (in Italian). In the session, we will explore the state-of-the-art of generative AI for multiple use cases. After taking a look at ChatGPT, Midjourney, ElevenLabs, and RunwayML, we will see how to implement similar services leveraging tools, frameworks (Intel OpenVINO, ONNX Runtime, NVIDIA TensorRT), and some open-source models, harnessing the computational power of our workstation or Azure.

If you haven't <a href="https://www.wpc.education/ticket?mtm_campaign=WPC_2023&mtm_kwd=Speaker&mtm_source=Social_MVP&mtm_content=giannirosagallina" target="_blank">registered</a> yet, now is the time to do so!
