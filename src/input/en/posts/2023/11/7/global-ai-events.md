Two amazing announcements today! <a href="https://globalai.community/" target="_blank">Global AI Community</a> organizers invited me and my good friend **<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clemente-giorio-03a61811/" target="_blank">Clemente Giorio</a>** (Microsoft MVP, Intel Innovator) for the upcoming **<a href="https://globalai.community/video/global-ai-notes/" target="_blank">Global AI Notes</a>** weekly online appointment, on **November 13th, 2023**.

The **Global AI Notes** is a weekly appointment, hosted by *Global AI Community* members, and delivered straight from the experts all around the world. From machine learning, robotics, big data, neural networks, and everything in between, it is a chat between speakers who share their latest discoveries and what's coming up next in the AI world. If you're a tech enthusiast or just curious, don't miss this exciting ride into the future of AI!

Join us at **10 AM (CET)** for the session **Generative AI Landscape: from popular services to open-source alternatives**</a>: we will explore the state-of-the-art of generative AI for various use cases. After providing an overview of the most renowned services such as *ChatGPT*, *Midjourney*, *ElevenLabs*, and *RunwayML*, we will show you potential approaches for implementing similar services on your own, by leveraging open-source tools, frameworks (such as *Intel OpenVINO*, *ONNX Runtime*, *NVIDIA TensorRT*), and models (such as *SAM*, *Stable Diffusion*, *Whisper*, *LLama*), while harnessing the computational power offered by your local workstation and/or Azure. You may already have seen a previous version of this session in Italian, ***but this is the first time we deliver it in English***!

In addition, we've also been confirmed as speakers for another amazing event: the **<a href="https://globalai.community/conference/" target="_blank">Global AI Conference 2023</a>**, always happening online, from all over the world, on **December 12th, 2023**.

The **Global AI Conference** is an all-day long event that brings together AI fans and experts from all over the world. It's put together by the *Global AI Community*, and it's a great opportunity to dive deep into the world of AI, so don't miss out!! AI developers, students, professional and everyone else passionate about AI should join this event!

We'll be presenting a brand new session: **Generative AI Unleashed: crafting voices and music from text & images**</a>. *While generative AI continues to evolve predominantly around text and imagery, the horizon is broadening with innovations in audio, synthesized voices, and music creation. This session provides an overview of the realm of generative AI for audio. Let's dive into hands-on examples, harnessing the power of open-source pre-trained models, and discover how the Microsoft ecosystem, among others, can be a powerful tool in this journey!*

You're warmly welcomed to join us during our sessions: for registration details and how to attend the events, please refer to the <a href="https://globalai.community/" target="_blank">official website</a>. Don't miss those fantastic opportunities to learn more!
